                    I was raised in Montana, where nature was always a big part of my life. I grew up camping, fishing, rock climbing, floating, and spending a lot of time outdoors. As I got into high school, I spent less and less time outside engaging in the experiences that had brought me so much joy. My mental health declined significantly. It got so severe that my family sent me away to a residential treatment center where I lived for three months receiving intensive behavioral health therapy. This experience changed my life and informed my decision to study psychology. While I was in treatment, my favorite part of everyday was when I got to go outside, hear the sound of the quaking aspens rustle in the wind, and feel the sun on my face.

                    As a mental health counselor, I meet you with an understanding of what it is like to suffer. With this understanding I strive to help you find hope, healing, and ultimately wellness. I believe that every person wants to be their most authentic selves. I use evidence based and experimental techniques to meet my clients wherever they are in their journey of healing to stand by their side as they explore their barriers to wellness with kindness and compassion for themselves.

                    My fondness of nature and my early work with tribal communities led me to specializing in nature-based therapy (NBT). Inviting nature into session gives clients access to a life-long healer that is always accessible, even after they have completed the counseling process. In a study by Meuwese et al., participants of NBT described nature being non-judgemental, reflecting change, growth, and inspiring curiosity. The participants felt that nature put their experiences into perspective and offered them comfort. Being in nature helped these study participants feel a sense of inner peace and interconnected to something greater than themselves (2021). Nature is an excellent companion to have on your journey to wellness, explore my offerings page to find more information.
