            The land on which I practice as a professional is the sacred homelands of the Spokane Tribe and has been enjoyed by other tribes of the region for generations, including but not limited to the Coeur d'Alene Tribe, Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, and Kalispel Tribe. I am grateful to the Spokane Tribal Community for the experience they granted me in my early career. I am also grateful for the inter-tribal community that came together to create the Integrative Cultural Healing Model. Being trained in this model helped to guide me in my career and brought me back to the land, which I am so grateful to share with the Spokanes’, Kalispells’, Collvilles’, Coeur D’ Alenes’, and other members of over 100 federally recognized tribes, and all of the non-natives who call the profoundly beautiful Spokane area home.
